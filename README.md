# ClipSaver

A Python Linux-based Application which will help you keep a history of the things you copy (only texts)

## Features
1) Let it run in background and it will automatically save your clips
2) You can create custom Lists to organize your clips
3) No need to worry about getting a clip in the wrong list, as you can move clips between lists
4) You can create Password Lists which will delete the clip if it is older than 1 day
5) Can delete unused Lists with a simple click

## Usage
Just download the release and you are good to go. (Prefered to keep the app in a separate folder as it will keep its clips in another file in the same location as itself)
